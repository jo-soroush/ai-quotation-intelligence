# AI Quotation Intelligence System — V1 Card Evidence Map

Status: CANONICAL EVIDENCE LEDGER
Implementation State: NOT_STARTED
Active Card: NONE
Authorization: NONE

## 0. Role and Ownership

QUOTATION_CARD_EVIDENCE_MAP.md records actual implementation evidence for every official V1 Card.

It owns:

- files actually changed;
- commands actually run;
- tests actually executed;
- test results;
- failures;
- evaluation results;
- Exit Gate evidence;
- Git evidence when Git exists;
- known limitations;
- learning records;
- Card completion proof.

It does not own:

- architecture;
- Roadmap identity or order;
- live authorization;
- Card contracts;
- project invariants.

Ownership:

PROJECT_PROFILE.md → stable architecture and invariants.
PROJECT_CONTROL.md → live state and authorization.
AI_QUOTATION_INTELLIGENCE_V1_ROADMAP.md → Card identity and order.
QUOTATION_CARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md → detailed Card contract.
QUOTATION_CARD_EVIDENCE_MAP.md → verified implementation evidence.
CARD_LEARNING_AND_DECISION_LOG.md → engineering rationale, alternatives, failure/root-cause/fix explanation, tradeoffs, and lessons learned.

This file does not authorize implementation.

The Evidence Map may record whether the Learning / Decision Log is current, but it does not duplicate its narrative. The Evidence Map owns observed and proven technical evidence and completion proof; CARD_LEARNING_AND_DECISION_LOG.md owns engineering rationale and learning. Documentation status is not implementation evidence: COMPLETE learning documentation does not prove code, tests, Exit Gates, AWS, Bedrock, S3, or Git delivery. Technical evidence does not prove that engineering rationale was documented. Both are independent completion requirements.

Learning Documentation Status vocabulary:

~~~text
NOT_STARTED → no implementation learning has been recorded
PARTIAL → some actual implementation reasoning is recorded but required learning remains incomplete
CURRENT → the record is up to date with the current implementation checkpoint
COMPLETE → the final learning record satisfies the Card completion documentation requirement
~~~

## 1. Evidence Principles

~~~
DESIGN INTENT != IMPLEMENTATION EVIDENCE
TEST NOT RUN != PASS
STATIC INSPECTION != RUNTIME VERIFICATION
EXPECTED RESULT != OBSERVED RESULT
CODE EXISTS != EXIT GATE PROVEN
MERGED != COMPLETE
DEPLOY CONFIG EXISTS != DEPLOYED
BEDROCK CODE EXISTS != BEDROCK VERIFIED
S3 CODE EXISTS != S3 VERIFIED
FAILURE IS EVIDENCE
UNKNOWN MUST STAY UNKNOWN
NO EVIDENCE → NO COMPLETION CLAIM
~~~

Never fabricate command output, test results, Git commits, AWS state, Bedrock responses, S3 behavior, deployment state, runtime behavior, file paths, or evaluation scores.

## 2. Current Project Evidence State

~~~
Project: AI Quotation Intelligence System
Target: V1
Application Implementation: NOT_STARTED
Active Card: NONE
Completed Cards: NONE
Implementation Evidence: NONE
Git Repository: NO
Tests: NOT_CREATED
AWS Implementation: NOT_STARTED
Bedrock Integration: NOT_STARTED
S3 Integration: NOT_STARTED
Deployment: NOT_STARTED
Golden Case: NOT_STARTED
~~~

Governance migration evidence is not V1 application implementation evidence.

## 3. Evidence Record Standard

Each Card record uses exactly these sections:

1. Card
2. Contract Source
3. State
4. Human Start Approval
5. Files Changed
6. Commands Run
7. Focused Tests
8. Relevant Regression
9. Card Evaluation
10. Commercial / Data Invariants
11. AI / Provider Validation
12. Security Validation
13. Failures / Blockers
14. Exit Gate Evidence
15. CARD_QUALITY_GATE
16. Git Evidence
17. Known Limitations
18. What We Learned
19. Completion Evidence
20. Recommended State

Current values are factual pre-implementation values only.

## 4. Future Evidence Expectations

These are expected evidence categories, not current evidence:

- V1-C01 — Repository Baseline: repository structure; Git initialization; configuration; importability; test baseline; .gitignore; secret hygiene
- V1-C02 — Domain Models: domain model files; validation tests; null/zero semantics; estimated/actual separation; numeric validation
- V1-C03 — Synthetic Historical Data: dataset or generator; record count; schema validity; synthetic provenance; designed pattern checks
- V1-C04 — Quote Calculation Engine: deterministic arithmetic; hours × rate; totals; edge cases; reconciliation
- V1-C05 — Historical Comparison Engine: hour/cost variance; percentage variance; aggregate statistics; missing actual handling
- V1-C06 — Similar Quote Retrieval: ranking/retrieval tests; explainable similarity; empty/insufficient results; no price-copy behavior
- V1-C07 — Risk Evidence Engine: evidence counts; supporting quote IDs; aggregate reconciliation; insufficient evidence behavior
- V1-C08 — Amazon Bedrock Integration: provider contract; Bedrock adapter; structured output validation; AI_INVALID; AI_UNAVAILABLE; provider isolation; real Bedrock verification only if executed
- V1-C09 — Agent Tools: tool contracts; validation; delegation to existing services; failure propagation
- V1-C10 — Quotation Agent: tool use; tool selection; structured result; unsupported claim rejection; no deterministic override; failure paths
- V1-C11 — Human Review Gate: approve path; reject path; approval-required behavior; invalid transition behavior
- V1-C12 — Excel Generation: workbook; required sheets; deterministic totals; reconciliation; approval requirement
- V1-C13 — FastAPI Application: API routes; typed validation; error mapping; business-logic delegation; approval behavior
- V1-C14 — Amazon S3 Integration: storage adapter; serialization; retrieval validation; failure behavior; provider isolation
- V1-C15 — AWS Deployment: Lambda/API Gateway artifacts; deployed verification; IAM review; local mode preserved
- V1-C16 — CloudWatch Observability: structured logs; correlation IDs; failure traceability; redaction; CloudWatch evidence if deployed
- V1-C17 — Evaluation Harness: repeatable evaluation cases; metric results; PASS/FAIL behavior; intentionally bad-case detection
- V1-C18 — Guardrails and Failure Handling: applicable failure states; no silent fallback; invalid AI rejection; approval boundary; Excel reconciliation; commercial invariant enforcement
- V1-C19 — Golden Case: complete end-to-end scenario; historical retrieval; deterministic analysis; RiskEvidence; Bedrock/agent; human approval; Excel; API/storage/cloud path where applicable; observability; evaluation
- V1-C20 — Demo UI: UI flow; draft/approved distinction; approval interaction; evidence display; Excel access; no duplicated business logic

## 5. Failure Recording Rule

Failures must be recorded rather than erased. Future failure records must include:

Timestamp:
Card:
Step:
Command/Test:
Observed Result:
Expected Result:
Failure Code:
Impact:
Rollback Needed:
Resolved:
Resolution Evidence:

A failed test remains visible after later repair.

## 6. Test Evidence Format

Future actual test records must include:

Command:
Scope:
Observed Result:
PASS / FAIL:
Relevant Output:
Files/Components Covered:
Limitations:

Do not write a generic “tests passed” claim without actual test identity and output.

## 7. Evaluation Evidence Format

Future evaluation records must include:

Evaluation ID:
Card:
Dataset/Case:
Metric:
Expected Threshold if defined:
Observed Value:
PASS / FAIL / INFORMATIONAL:
Evidence Source:
Limitations:

Do not invent thresholds unless defined by the owning Card or approved evaluation design.

## 8. Commercial / Data Invariant Evidence

Future evidence must explicitly prove applicable rules such as:

~~~
missing != zero
estimated != actual
rates validated
currency explicit
deterministic totals
variance deterministic
evidence counts reconcile
RiskEvidence traceable
synthetic provenance preserved
Excel totals reconcile
~~~

These are not marked PASS globally. They become evidence per Card.

## 9. AI Evidence

Future AI evidence must distinguish:

- mocked provider test;
- local adapter test;
- real Bedrock call;
- agent evaluation.

A mocked response is not live Bedrock verification.

Where applicable, record model ID, provider, structured schema, tool calls, failure state, validated output, unsupported claims, latency, and token metadata only when actually available.

Do not store secrets or sensitive prompt contents unnecessarily.

## 10. AWS Evidence

Future AWS evidence must distinguish:

- configuration exists;
- resource created;
- resource deployed;
- resource invoked successfully.

For S3, an adapter test is not real S3 verification. For Lambda/API Gateway, deployment configuration is not a deployed API. For CloudWatch, logging code is not CloudWatch evidence.

## 11. Git Evidence

Once Git exists, Card evidence may record:

Branch:
Start Commit:
End Commit:
Commit:
Push:
PR:
Merge:

Until Git exists:

NOT_AVAILABLE

Never invent a commit hash.

## 12. Exit Gate Proof

Every Card Exit Gate must later be proven with specific evidence:

Exit Gate Requirement:
Evidence:
PASS / FAIL / NOT_PROVEN:
Notes:

A Card cannot be COMPLETE if any required Exit Gate condition is NOT_PROVEN.

## 13. CARD_QUALITY_GATE

Future gate fields:

Focused Tests:
Relevant Regression:
Card Evaluation:
Commercial/Data Invariants:
AI Validation:
Security Validation:
Exit Gate:
Evidence Current:
PROJECT_CONTROL Updated:
Git Diff Reviewed:
Git Status Reviewed:
Known Limitations Recorded:

CARD_QUALITY_GATE:
PASS | BLOCKED | NOT_RUN

Current value for every Card: NOT_RUN.

## 14. Completion Rule

Card COMPLETE requires:

- exact contract satisfied;
- required tests actually executed;
- required evaluation actually executed;
- applicable invariants proven;
- failures resolved or explicitly accepted;
- exact Exit Gate proven;
- evidence map current;
- What We Learned recorded;
- CARD_QUALITY_GATE PASS;
- Git evidence current where applicable;
- PROJECT_CONTROL reconciled;
- approved delivery complete where required.

Without these:

NOT COMPLETE

## 15. Evidence Update Discipline

Update evidence incrementally during implementation. Do not reconstruct history from memory.

After meaningful validation, record the observed result. After failure, record it immediately. After recovery, record both the original failure and recovery proof.

Evidence Map: records observed failure and recovery evidence.
Learning Log: records explanation, root cause, fix rationale, tradeoff, and lesson.

Future Card completion requires the Evidence Map to be current AND the Learning / Decision Log to be current before CARD_QUALITY_GATE may PASS. Neither record replaces the other.

Governance migration output is not V1 application Card evidence.
